# DB25 External BlueSCSI

This is a forked and modified BlueSCSI DB25 External PCB.

It's fully compatible with the original software.

The goal was first to make a PCB anyone can solder at home.

The modifications are :

 * The DB25 connector is mounted in the middle side of the PCB

 * The pico is soldered under the board with no component in between
 * All passive components are 0805 handsolderable, only a few resistors are under the board
 * New microSD card connector, with sping
 * Almost every component is available on mouser or digikey if you want to assemble it yourself

For the first batch of 9 circuits, the PCBs were made by AISLER (Germany) 
and assembled with a voltera V-One for the solder paste dispensing, 
a small pick&place machine (Neoden YY1) for most passives and the rest by hand.

Reflow was done on a hot plate.
